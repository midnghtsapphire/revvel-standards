### Summary

_No response_

### Objective

The relatedPRs variable at line 122 is destructured from a listForRepo call but is never referenced anywhere in the script. The actual PR lookup is done via the search.issuesAndPullRequests call at line 130. Before this PR, this call would have failed (missing owner/repo), likely crashing the step. Now that the PR adds owner/repo, this call succeeds — but fetches up to 50 issues with state: 'all' and no filtering, discards the result, and runs once per stuck issue in the loop. This wastes GitHub API rate limit quota on every iteration. Consider removing it or replacing it with the intended filtered query.

- [x] The PR should reflect the WR's required bundle and definition of done.
