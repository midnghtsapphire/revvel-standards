**Task Attempted:** External full-repo prosecution audit (Claude, chat session) — gaps, broken wiring, errors, bugs across revvel-standards. 10 WRs filed at `wr/pending/audit-2026-07-14/`, pushed via Zapier GitHub MCP on branch `audit/2026-07-14-wr-a1`.

**Outcome:** Success — audit complete, fixes proven empirically, WRs + memory + skill files landed on branch, PR opened for review.

**Root Cause of Failure (If any):** Audited a clone snapshot; at push time live main had already gained a partial WR-A1 fix (yaml/ajv/ajv-formats/@types/node landed; semver + @octokit/rest still missing). Remaining audit findings verified still live: state.json = `{}` (issue-13555), 3 workflows calling missing scripts (call-cursor-api.sh, record.js, index.js), 13 pull_request_target workflows, gitbito@main unpinned, 5 duplicate issue files, 5 broken SSOT links, 78 cron workflows unbudgeted.

**Self-Healing Fix / Learned Lesson:** (1) **Audits decay — re-verify every finding against live HEAD before applying fixes**; merge into current state, never overwrite newer work with stale audit copies. This bit twice in one session (package.json, learnings.md itself). (2) Cluster failures by root cause before filing: 23 test failures were 1 bug (undeclared deps); proven fix took the suite 482 discovered → 631/631 green + clean tsc. (3) Fix + vaccine together: every corrective WR names the guard preventing recurrence (WR-A10 dependency-declaration lint is WR-A1's vaccine). Full toolchain + method documented in `wr/memory/audit-2026-07-14-tools.md`; reusable procedure codified in `skills/repo-audit/SKILL.md`.

**Next Action:** Review/merge PR from `audit/2026-07-14-wr-a1`. Then agents execute WR-A1..A10 in priority order (A2 state engine and A3 dead script paths first — both P0/P1 and both currently breaking live automation).
