# Goap Agent Memory & Self-Healing Log

  - Before writing: check this file exists at this path. Do NOT create a duplicate.
  - Writes must be append-only and atomic (write to a temp file, then rename/move).
  - On lock or write failure: save entry to learnings.tmp as a rollback buffer; retry on next run.
  - Malformed entries (missing required fields) must be flagged with a [MALFORMED] prefix and NOT deleted.
  - Archive entries older than 90 days to DigitalOcean Spaces under goap-logs/archive/.

**Rule:** Read this file at the start of every session. Append after every task or failure. Never repeat the same mistake twice.

This file tracks autonomous executions, failures, root causes, and locked-in solutions so mistakes are never repeated.

**Date/Time:**

**Task Attempted:** [e.g., n8n email parse for angelreporters@gmail.com]

**Root Cause of Failure (If any):** [e.g., IMAP connection timed out after 30s]

**Self-Healing Fix / Learned Lesson:** [e.g., Added an automatic 3-minute retry node in n8n; switched Apify actor to use residential proxies]

**Next Action:** [e.g., Proceed to Video Generation step]

**Task Attempted:** Fix recurring `oAudrey retro` issues reporting HTTP 000 for `oaudrey.com` and `fieldwork.oaudrey.com`

**Outcome:** Infrastructure blocker identified and documented; workflow deduplication implemented; AGENTS.md improved

**Root Cause of Failure (If any):** The oAudrey deployment requires two human-only one-time actions that were never performed: (1) setting the `DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN` GitHub Actions secret, and (2) pointing `oaudrey.com` nameservers to DigitalOcean in the Namecheap registrar (`uprisinghope` account). Without these, `curl` returns `HTTP 000` (DNS does not resolve; no app was ever deployed). The retro workflow was also creating a brand-new issue every week with no deduplication check, generating compounding noise.

**Self-Healing Fix / Learned Lesson:**
1. **Infrastructure blockers ≠ code blockers.** When `curl` returns `HTTP 000` for a domain and the deploy workflow has never run with a valid credential, this is an infrastructure blocker that no amount of code changes can fix. Classify it immediately and escalate with exact human steps.
2. **Deduplication is required for recurring automated issues.** Any workflow that opens an issue on a schedule MUST check for existing open issues first and comment on them instead of cloning.
3. **SYSTEM_STATE.md `⏳` state.** Use `⏳ Pending human action` (not `❌`) to distinguish "this is intentionally not deployed yet" from "this needs a human to take a specific action." Agents reading `❌` with a comment like "(standards repo)" assume the component is not meant to be deployed; `⏳` with exact steps is unambiguous.
4. **New section in AGENTS.md: Infrastructure Blocker Protocol.** Added clear classification table and handling steps so future agents stop the retry loop immediately.

**Next Action:** Human (Audrey) must set `DIGITALOCEAN_API_TOKEN` secret and update Namecheap DNS. See `docs/AGENTS_RETRO_REVIEW.md` for full analysis and `standards/OAUDREY_DEPLOYMENT_STANDARD.md` for step-by-step instructions.

**Task Attempted:** Fix YAML parsing errors in GitHub Actions workflow files revvel-standards

**Outcome:** Success - All 334 tests now passing

**Root Cause of Failure (If any):** 
- `credential-label-router.yml` and `weekly-research.yml` had YAML parsing errors due to multiline JavaScript template literal strings
- Lines in template literal strings starting with text (like "This issue has been routed..." or "**What happens next:**") without proper indentation were being interpreted as new YAML keys
- Lines containing only "---" were being interpreted as YAML document separators
- The YAML parser requires ALL text within script blocks to have consistent indentation (12 spaces)

**Self-Healing Fix / Learned Lesson:**
1. **Identify all script blocks with backtick template literals** - Find lines with "= \`" that start script blocks in YAML
2. **Fix ALL lines within the block, not just some** - The opening line has indentation, but subsequent lines need it too
3. **Remove standalone "---" lines** - These are YAML document separators and break flow scalar parsing
4. **Include the closing line in fixes** - Even the line ending with `_`; needs proper indentation

**Next Action:** None - Work complete

## 2026-05-02: Repository Revvel-Standards Audit

### What Was Done
- Ran all 7 repositories through revvel-standards audit
- Fixed TypeScript error in thealttext-frontend (`context` parameter)
- Added TEST sections to all READMEs per revvel-standards requirements
- Created comprehensive REPO_AUDIT.md in revvel-standards

### Repositories Audited
| Repo | Tests | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| reese-reviews | 245 ✅ | Complete |
| neurooz | 27 ✅ | Complete |
| revvel-standards | 334 ✅ | Fixed (was) |
| thealttext-frontend | N/A | Fixed |
| Soup2Bowl | N/A | Complete |
| mindmappr | 3 ✅ | Complete |
| revvel-music-studio | N/A | Complete |
| thealttext-backend | N/A | **Blocked** |

### Key Fixes
- **thealttext-frontend:** Added `context?: string` to analyzeFile options type in api.ts to fix TypeScript error

### Infrastructure Blockers
- **thealttext-backend:** Requires PostgreSQL database - documented in README

### Lessons Learned
1. Always check build first - catches TypeScript errors early
2. TEST section template helps standardize all repos
3. Some repos need infrastructure (PostgreSQL) - document as blockers
4. All repos now have proper TEST sections with Vercel placeholder URLs

### Next Steps (Human Action Needed)
1. Deploy each repo to Vercel Dashboard or CLI
2. Replace placeholder URLs with real Vercel URLs
3. Set up PostgreSQL for thealttext-backend

**Task Attempted:** Fix current revvel-standards automation/test failures after false stuck-WR escalation for WR #13460.

**Outcome:** Success — stuck-WR detector now recognizes existing WR PRs by issue branch, issue references, and workflow-created PR comments; workflow YAML validation is clean; BITO verifier and dashboard parser failures are repaired; `npm test` passes.

**Root Cause of Failure (If any):** The detector relied on title-only GitHub search, which missed already-created PRs and opened false P0 stuck issues. Full validation also exposed stale workflow/test contracts: malformed YAML in two workflows, BITO verifier drift from the live workflow action/secret names, and a dashboard parser that found markdown links without assigning them.

**Self-Healing Fix / Learned Lesson:** Use deterministic workflow signals for dedupe/association instead of fuzzy title searches. When `npm test` fails past the original issue, keep walking the chain: syntax failures and stale contract tests are actionable code/config blockers, while missing repository secrets are warnings/infrastructure signals when the script cannot inspect them. Generated dashboards must exclude dependency folders and avoid checkout-path-derived names.

**Next Action:** Merge PR #13469 after review/CI; the branch already includes unit coverage and passing full local validation.

**Date/Time:** 2026-05-17T02:45:00Z

**Task Attempted:** Fix PR #13482 merge readiness for the Life Insurance Lead Engine after cubic identified the newsletter opt-out compliance mismatch.

**Outcome:** Success — added a real local newsletter opt-out path, corrected the product README compliance claim, removed incomplete-work language, upgraded the product dependency/tooling stack, and verified `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and `npm audit` all pass in `products/life-insurance-lead-engine/build`.

**Root Cause of Failure (If any):** The original newsletter component only set a submitted flag and contained an unwired integration TODO while product docs claimed GDPR/CCPA opt-out support. Validation also exposed stale package choices: an old vulnerable Next.js version, vulnerable `xlsx`, no lockfile for auditability, and a lint script tied to the removed `next lint` command.

**Self-Healing Fix / Learned Lesson:** PR review fixes should validate the changed app, not only the reviewed line. For Next 16 apps, use `eslint .` with the flat `eslint-config-next` exports, run `next typegen` before direct `tsc --noEmit`, set `turbopack.root` for nested product apps, and replace abandoned vulnerable packages (`xlsx`) with maintained patched forks (`@e965/xlsx`) when API-compatible.

**Next Action:** Merge PR #13482 after CI confirms the pushed branch.
